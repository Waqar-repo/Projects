# Projects 📁

Welcome to the **Projects** repository — a centralized home for all the development projects I've worked on or am currently building.

This repo serves as a portfolio of my coding journey, where I apply what I learn, solve real problems, and explore ideas through hands-on development.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- 🛠 Showcase complete and in-progress projects
- 📦 Keep my work organised in one place
- 🚀 Track my progress and growth over time
- 🧪 Experiment with features, designs, and architectures

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project lives in its own folder:

## 📝 Notes

- Some projects may be small prototypes, while others could be more fully-featured apps.
- Every project includes its own README with setup instructions and an overview.
- Feedback, ideas, and suggestions are always welcome!
