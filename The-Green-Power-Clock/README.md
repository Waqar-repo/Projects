UK Green Energy Checker
A simple web tool that tells you how "clean" your electricity is right now based on your postcode.

What does this project do?
In the UK, the electricity in our homes comes from different sources like wind, solar, gas, or coal. Because the weather changes, the "cleanliness" of our power changes every 30 minutes.

This website allows a user to:

Enter their UK Postcode (e.g., G1, EH1, or SW1).

See a Live Rating: It shows if the carbon footprint is "Very Low," "Moderate," or "High."

See the Source: It shows exactly where the power is coming from (for example: 80% Wind, 10% Solar).

🛠️ How I built it
I used the three core pillars of web development:

HTML5: To create the structure and the search bar.

CSS3: To make the site look professional and change colors (Green for clean energy, Red for high carbon).

JavaScript: To "talk" to the National Grid API and fetch live data without refreshing the page.

Why I built this
I wanted to build something meaningful that uses Real-World Data. This project shows that I can:

Connect a website to a professional government database (API).

Handle live data and display it in an easy-to-read way.

Help people make greener choices, like waiting for a "Low Carbon" time to run their washing machine.
